### USING THE REPORT TO MOVE or REMOVE FILES
Removing files can be tricky and best done with care, best to move files before removal.  A file may use its directory name to give it meaning or the directory name may irrelevant and the file name may be important.
 
A removal or move list can created from either spreadsheet (__duplicate_files1_yymmdd-hhmm.csv__ or __duplicate_files2_yymmdd-hhmm.csv__).

#### Bulk moving of all duplicates 
This example moves all files on a list to a single directory, only one copy (by name) is kept. Suggest testing with a small sample. 
Have all the files to move in a single spreadsheet column. All columns with any other contents should be deleted. 
Save as text (don't NOT save as a DOS file if file names have non-Latin characters, usually will save to the UTF-8 format, which preserves non-Latin characters). For each line in the file has to be transformed from something like this


__/mnt/c/photos 2022/IMG-202201291815__  

To

__mv -f ‘/mnt/c/photos 2022/IMG-202201291815’ ‘/mnt/c/Temp/Duplicates/’__

Alternative to using an editor to modify each line this can be done in bulk using linux commands. First convert the Windows text list to a Linux format list.  _This is mandatory_ 

Run __dos2unix windows_list tmp_list__   This command will preserve UTF-8 characters.
  
The following commands will add:

* _mv -f ‘_  to the start of every line

* _‘ ‘/mnt/c/Temp/Duplicates’_  to the end of every line

__awk '{printf "mv -f \x27%s\x27 \x27/mnt/c/Temp/Duplicates/\x27\n",$0}' tmp_list  > move_list__

alternatively

__sed 's/^/mv -f \x27/' tmp_list | sed 's/$/\x27 \x27\\/mnt\\/c\\/Temp\\/Duplicates\\/\x27/' > move_list__

Where 
* \x27 is used to denote a ' 
* each / of the path is preceding by a \ 

Once done, check the list.  If all is OK run 

__bash move_list__
